# Dynamic Form Builder

## Overview
This dynamic HTML form building tool is made to help you by:
1. Extracting an array of objects sequentially
2. Determining the type of input in each object
3. Outputting the HTML accordingly
   * If the code doesn't recognize the input, it will just output "Something went wrong."
4. Logging the HTML through the console
